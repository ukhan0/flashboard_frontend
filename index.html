Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services.

Claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are effectively subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of our subsidiaries. The Indentures do not restrict our ability or that of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness.\n Payment on the Notes\n All payments of principal of, the redemption price (if any), and interest and additional amounts (if any) on the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes are payable in euro, provided that, if the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company’s control, or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"126\" > European Monetary Union </ner> that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes will be made in U.S. dollars, until the euro is again available to the Company or so used.

If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders.\n The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of any series may rescind a declaration of acceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of default with respect to the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal or interest which have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the Indentures.\n An event of default for a particular series of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities issued under the Indentures.\n We are required to furnish the trustee annually within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year a statement by one of our officers to the effect that, to the best knowledge of such officer, we are not in default in the fulfillment of any of our obligations under the applicable Indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default and the nature and status thereof.\n No holder of any <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of any series will have any right to institute any judicial or other proceeding with respect to the applicable Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy unless:\n (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such holder has given the trustee prior written notice of such continuing event of default with respect to the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series;\n (2) in the case of the 2013 Indenture, the holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, the holders of not less than 33% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series have requested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default;\n (3) the trustee has been offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses and liabilities in complying with such request;\n (4) the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days after the receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity; and\n (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of such series.\n The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of a series will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. Each of the Indentures provides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under such Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of a series unless they will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on that <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security on or after the due dates expressed in that <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.\n Modification and Waivers\n Modification and amendments of the Indentures and the Notes may be made by us and the trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes affected thereby; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note of that series affected thereby:\n •change the stated maturity of the principal of, or installment of interest on, any Note;\n •reduce the principal amount of any Note or reduce the amount of the principal of any Note which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or reduce the rate of interest on any Note;\n •reduce any premium payable on the redemption of any Note or change the date on which any Note may or must be redeemed (in the case of the 2018 Indenture, it being understood that a change to any notice requirement with respect to such date shall not be deemed to be a change of such date);\n •change the coin or currency in which the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is payable;\n •impair the right of any holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated maturity of any Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);\n •reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the consent of whose holders is required in order to take certain actions;\n •reduce the requirements for quorum or voting by holders of Notes in the applicable Indenture or the Note;\n •modify any of the provisions in the applicable Indenture regarding the waiver of past defaults and the waiver of certain covenants by the holders of Notes except to increase any percentage vote required or to provide that certain other provisions of the applicable Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each Notes affected thereby;\n •make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security or decreases the conversion or exchange rate or increases the conversion price of any convertible or exchangeable <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities; or\n •modify any of the above provisions.\n We and the trustee may, without the consent of any holders, modify or amend the terms of the Indentures and any series of Notes with respect to the following:\n •to add to our covenants for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon us;\n •to evidence the succession of another person to, and the assumption by the successor of our covenants, agreements and obligations under, the applicable Indenture pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;\n •to add any additional events of default for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes;\n •to add one or more guarantees, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, co-obligors, for the benefit of holders of the Notes;\n •to secure the Notes pursuant to the covenants of the Indenture;\n •to add or appoint a successor or separate trustee or other agent;\n •to provide for the issuance of additional <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of any series;\n •to establish the form or terms of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of any series as permitted by the Indenture;\n •to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository;\n •to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;\n •in the case of the 2013 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2013 Indenture in respect of one or more series of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities; provided that any such addition, change or elimination (a) shall neither (1) apply to any <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (2) modify the rights of the holder of any such <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when there is no <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> security described in clause (a)(1) outstanding;\n •in the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018 Indenture in respect of one or more series of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities; provided that any such addition, change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to which such supplemental indenture would apply;\n •to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;\n •to change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect;\n •to supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture; provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such series or any other series of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities in any material respect;\n •to comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and\n •to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in the case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or interests of any holder of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities in any material respect.\n The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the Indentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series \n may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the applicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.\n Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n We may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\n The Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released from our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenant defeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\n If we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration.\n With respect to the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term “U.S. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the German <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> or the central bank of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"111\" > German </ner> government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. \n With respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term “U.S. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"130\" > United Kingdom </ner> <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"130\" > United Kingdom </ner> <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"130\" > United Kingdom </ner> <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"108\" > government </ner> or the central bank of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"130\" > United Kingdom </ner> government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. \n We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance will not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for \n federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\n We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.\n Book-Entry and Settlement\n The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary on behalf of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"129\" > Euroclear </ner> and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes.\n Certificated Notes\n Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor, in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, if: \n 1.the common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the common depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;\n 2. we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or\n 3. an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing. \n Any Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. \n The Trustee for the Notes\n The Bank of <span class=\"yellowColor\">New</span> York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with The Bank of <span class=\"yellowColor\">New</span> York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates (“BNYM”). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"125\" > BNYM </ner> in the future in the normal course of business. In addition, <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"125\" > BNYM </ner> acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities issued by us, and may do so for future issuances of <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"122\" > debt </ner> securities by us as well.",

If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly notify Apple Inc.’s Stock Plan Group of your decision at stock@apple.com. If you do not provide such notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the Vesting Date, you will be deemed to have accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\n RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\n PERFORMANCE AWARD\n 1. General\n . These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “ Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\n 2. Stock Units\n . As used herein, the term “Stock Unit” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"115\" > Common Stock </ner> (“Share”) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such Stock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n 3. Vesting\n . Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “ Vesting Date”).\n 4. Continuance of Employment\n . Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\n Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his or her consent thereto.\n 5. Dividend and <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"106\" > Voting Rights </ner> .\n (a) Limitations on Rights Associated with Stock Units\n . The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.\n (b) Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions\n . As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A . No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A .\n 6. Restrictions on Transfer\n . Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n 7. Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units\n . On or as soon as administratively practical following the vesting event pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.\n 8. Effect of Termination of Service\n . Except as provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date. In the event the Participant’s Severance Date is the result of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the Stock \n Units as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but for the Termination of Service and to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii) the Severance Fraction (determined as set forth below). Any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are unvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the Severance Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Severance Date, and any Stock Units that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Vesting Date. The “ Severance Fraction” means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be determined by subtracting the number of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance Date from the total number of days in the Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the Performance Period. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A ) without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n 9. Recoupment\n . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n (a)\n during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"137\" > United States </ner> or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n (b)\n during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;\n (c)\n during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n 10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events\n . Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n 11. Responsibility for Taxes\n . The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n (a) \n withholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n (b) \n withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n (c)\n arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or\n (d) \n withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant's jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are \n held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n 12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance\n . <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive all applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line (and/or voice activated) system established and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.\n 13. Data Privacy\n . The Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant, including the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan (“ Data”). <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> and its related entities may transfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or otherwise).\n 14. Notices\n . Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"137\" > United States </ner> Government.\n 15. Plan\n . The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan after the date hereof.\n 16. Entire Agreement\n . This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver \n does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.\n 17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights . \n Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Stock Units, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to Stock Units, as and when payable hereunder.\n 18. Section Headings\n . The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.\n 19. Governing Law\n . This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.\n 20. Choice of Venue\n . For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"83\" > District </ner> of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.\n 21. Construction\n . It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.\n 22. Severability\n . The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n 23. Imposition of Other Requirements\n . <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n * * * * *\n PERFORMANCE AWARD\n EXHIBIT A\n PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS\n The Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.\n The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n For <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the Stock Units that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.\n The number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the Stock Units will not vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.\n For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:\n •“TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> among the TSRs for the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members for the Performance Period. In determining the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members for that same period, the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for that period as being greater than such other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members.\n •“Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first day of the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to be listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be treated as a <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or \n traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a <span class=\"yellowColor\">new</span> parent company by a <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interests in the original <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member or the assets and liabilities of such <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member immediately prior to the transaction, such <span class=\"yellowColor\">new</span> parent company shall be substituted for the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member are not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction.\n •“TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and other distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n •“Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n •“Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustment to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending Price, as the case may be).\n In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final and binding.\n * * * * *",

If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly notify Apple Inc.’s Stock Plan Group of your decision at stock@apple.com. If you do not provide such notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the Vesting Date, you will be deemed to have accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\n RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\n PERFORMANCE AWARD\n 1. General\n . These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “ Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\n 2. Stock Units\n . As used herein, the term “Stock Unit” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"115\" > Common Stock </ner> (“Share”) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such Stock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n 3. Vesting\n . Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “ Vesting Date”).\n 4. Continuance of Employment\n . Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\n Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his or her consent thereto.\n 5. Dividend and <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"106\" > Voting Rights </ner> .\n (a) Limitations on Rights Associated with Stock Units\n . The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.\n (b) Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions\n . As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A . No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A .\n 6. Restrictions on Transfer\n . Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n 7. Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units\n . On or as soon as administratively practical following the vesting event pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.\n 8. Effect of Termination of Service\n . Except as provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date. In the event the Participant’s Severance Date is the result of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the Stock \n Units as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but for the Termination of Service and to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii) the Severance Fraction (determined as set forth below). Any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are unvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the Severance Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Severance Date, and any Stock Units that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Vesting Date. The “ Severance Fraction” means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be determined by subtracting the number of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance Date from the total number of days in the Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the Performance Period. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A ) without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n 9. Recoupment\n . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n (a)\n during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"137\" > United States </ner> or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n (b)\n during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;\n (c)\n during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n 10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events\n . Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n 11. Responsibility for Taxes\n . The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant’s employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n (a) \n withholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n (b) \n withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n (c)\n arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or\n (d) \n withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant's jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are \n held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n 12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance\n . <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive all applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line (and/or voice activated) system established and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.\n 13. Data Privacy\n . The Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant, including the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan (“ Data”). <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> and its related entities may transfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or otherwise).\n 14. Notices\n . Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the <ner type=\"LOC\"  id=\"137\" > United States </ner> Government.\n 15. Plan\n . The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan after the date hereof.\n 16. Entire Agreement\n . This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver \n does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.\n 17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights . \n Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Stock Units, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to Stock Units, as and when payable hereunder.\n 18. Section Headings\n . The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.\n 19. Governing Law\n . This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.\n 20. Choice of Venue\n . For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"83\" > District </ner> of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.\n 21. Construction\n . It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.\n 22. Severability\n . The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n 23. Imposition of Other Requirements\n . <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"57\" > The Company </ner> reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n * * * * *\n PERFORMANCE AWARD\n EXHIBIT A\n PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS\n The Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.\n The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n •If the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.\n For <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the Stock Units that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.\n The number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the Stock Units will not vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.\n For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:\n •“TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> among the TSRs for the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members for the Performance Period. In determining the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members for that same period, the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"142\" > TSR </ner> for that period as being greater than such other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members.\n •“Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first day of the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to be listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member of the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be treated as a <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or \n traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a <span class=\"yellowColor\">new</span> parent company by a <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interests in the original <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member or the assets and liabilities of such <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member immediately prior to the transaction, such <span class=\"yellowColor\">new</span> parent company shall be substituted for the <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member are not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction.\n •“TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and other distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n •“Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n •“Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other <ner type=\"ORG\"  id=\"139\" > Comparison Group </ner> member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.\n With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustment to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending Price, as the case may be).\n In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final and binding.\n * * * * *",
